        from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations 
        to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society at large. 
        Hamlet is the most performed play of all time. The stage history records an 
        ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what 
        it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of 
        their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but 
        on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in 
        this century, direction and design. Although the volume as a whole 
        concentrates on stage performances in England and the US, outstanding 
        film versions and European stage productions are also featured. 
        Professor Hapgood makes extensive use of primary sources and his 
        substantial commentary provides numerous details of line-readings, 
        costuming and stage business culled from this research.',

        'Macbeth', 
        'The New Cambridge Shakespeare appeals to students worldwide for 
        its up-to-date scholarship and emphasis on performance. The series 
        features line-by-line commentaries and textual notes on the 
        plays and poems. Introductions are regularly refreshed with 
        accounts of new critical, stage and screen interpretations. 
        This second edition of Macbeth provides a thorough reconsideration 
        of one of Shakespeares most popular plays. In his introduction, 
        A. R. Braunmuller explores Macbeths immediate theatrical and 
        political contexts, particularly the Gunpowder Plot, and addresses 
        such celebrated questions as: do the Witches compel Macbeth to murder;
        is Lady Macbeth herself in some sense a witch; is Macduff morally
        culpable? A new and well-illustrated account of the play in performance 
        examines several cinematic versions, such as those by Kurosawa and Roman 
        Polanski, as well as other dramatic adaptations. Several possible new 
        sources are suggested and the presence of Thomas Middleton
        s writing in the play is also proposed.','27 November 2008',
